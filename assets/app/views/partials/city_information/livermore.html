    <h3>Livermore at a glance</h3>

    <p>Historic Livermore has even more to offer today as the metro areas of San Jose and San Francisco are brought
        closer to this once rural location via transit and technology. Offering a pleasant mix of modern and country
        feel, Livermore is a unique northern Californian treasure. Famous for the massive Lawrence Livermore Laboratory,
        the city is also known for its mix of classic and contemporary housing, vineyards and growing wine industry, and
        excellent eclectic dining.</p>

    <h3>Location</h3>

    <p>Livermore marks the eastern end of the trivalley area, as the valley floor climbs steeply to the wind farms and
        rolling hills of the Altamont. As the eastern side of the Altamont slopes down in turn, Alameda county gives way
        to San Joaquin county and the last bastions of true urban living in Northern California. West of this range, the
        Livermore valley has greeted millions of land travellers to the region over the last few centuries, giving them
        their first peek at the last valley before the bay on the other side of the Berkeley and Oakland hills.</p>

    <p>Much likes its wines, Livermore presents itself with delightfully crisp views of the trivalley area, with a
        smooth and subtle finish that is the result of a diverse yet accessible culture.</p>

    <h3>Transit</h3>

    <p>Recent freeway expansions on the East/West i580 artery have increased capacity and convenience by bringing more
        lanes and HOV options. While the BART system does not extend to Livermore, it is only a hop away in neighboring
        Dublin/Pleasanton. Moreoever, Livermore benefits from the i84 route connecting the 580 to the 680 southbound,
        serving numerous commuters headed to the Silicon Valley. You might still find a sign of the Old West here and
        there in the form of a stage coach, but the modern commuter has access to good options to travel to or from the
        Livermore valley.
