    <h3>Hayward at a glance</h3>
    Hayward is a large suburb sitting directly on the San Francisco Bay near to the San Mateo - Hayward bridge that
    transports nearly a quarter of the daily traffic from the East Bay to the peninsula. As of the 2010 Census it is
    nearly equally split between owner occupied and rental properties.

    is home to countless species of fish and fowl.

    <h3>Location</h3>
    Like its neighbors in Union City and San Leandro, Hayward boasts a great location in the East Bay, midway between
    San Jose/Silicon Valley and San Francisco. It is literally referred to as the 'heart of the Bay Area' for its easy
    access to San Jose, San Francisco, and just about every other part of the Bay Area.

    With some of the largest open space reserves in the area, Hayward is a great location to take in everything that the
    Bay Area has to offer. The city has come a long way in the last 25 years according to most long time residents. If
    the city adapts itself to better take advantage of its strategic position in the East Bay, current property values
    would be a tremendous bargain.
