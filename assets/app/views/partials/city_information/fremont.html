  <h3>Fremont at a glance</h3>
  Fremont is the largest of San Francisco's suburbs, and among the most populous. The city has a rich historical
  pedigree, and unique character given its fairly recent formation from the consolidation of five existing communities
  in Centerville, Niles, Irvington, Mission San Jose and Warm Springs

  Today the sprawling suburban area merges together with Newark and Union City, and is associated equally with the San
  Francisco Peninsula, but also San Jose and Silicon Valley.
